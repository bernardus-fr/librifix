Preface

Welcome to a universe where artificial intelligence meets the depths of the cosmos, a universe that is both fascinating and absurd, scientific and ridiculous. You are about to dive into a book that doesn’t necessarily deserve all the attention you’re about to give it. But don’t worry, it’s not your fault. This book, like all books, was written with the pretense of captivating you, while at the same time, being, upon further reflection, a bit… well, a bit nothing at all. It's not really a traditional book. In reality, it's more of a pretext, a device, a sort of exercise where form takes precedence over content, where technology and creativity intersect in a… let's say, intriguing way.

It’s not every day that a book tells you it’s not trying to educate you, move you, or convince you of anything. No, this book, AI and Cosmos, has much more modest ambitions: to present you with a project. A project that doesn’t seek to change the world, but rather to show you how it is possible to give life to an eBook with no effort, no transformation of a great literary work, no major means. A project that, truth be told, doesn’t take itself too seriously but, with a certain irony, hopes to bring a small smile—or at least a slight raise of an eyebrow.

This project is Librifix. It’s neither a revolution nor a utopia. It’s a bit like a simple recipe where you take plain text, and with the help of a few well-crafted lines of code, you transform it into a perfectly structured eBook. No magic here, just technology that, like a wand, shapes a digital object out of… well… nothing. No mystery, no secret sauce, just a tool that does its job well. As you can see, this isn’t literature, it’s not a philosophical quest, it’s not even a grand cosmic narrative: it’s a demonstration. A technical demonstration, and nothing more.

Don’t expect any philosophical depth hidden between the lines. There is none. Don’t look for any existential revelation around the corner of each chapter. There isn’t one either. This book is primarily an experimental playground, an example, an invitation to reflect on how technology can, while remaining invisible, give life to a work. It’s not complicated, but it looks like a great digital creation, so why not enjoy it?

The real purpose of this book is to open a small window for the curious, for lovers of technology and eBooks. If you enjoy irony, lightness, and the thought of discovering a project that gently mocks the pretension of grand narratives, then this is the right place for you. Don’t expect a deep literary experience here, but rather an absurd journey through ideas and concepts, where reality is often stranger than fiction, and where irony takes the lead over any serious intention.

Behind every word, every page, every chapter, is the discreet work of a program, an intelligent algorithm that brings this book to life before your eyes. You might think it’s the work of an inspired writer. Think again. This book is the work of a technical project. This project is Librifix. It’s here to show you that a text can be transformed into a well-organized eBook, but at the same time, the form of a book is a bit like a mirage, an illusion created by tools we’ve made almost invisible.

So sit back and enjoy this journey through galaxies of ideas, where the serious is but a starting point and never a destination. This book has no answers to give you, no profound truths to share. This book is a path, not a destination. It is the reflection of a project that has no ambition except to make you smile and remind you that sometimes, the essential thing is not to take ourselves too seriously.

Welcome to AI and Cosmos, and remember: there’s no hidden message, just a test. A test that, perhaps, will make you look at digital technology with a new perspective.
