Chapter 5 Footnotes

1) While AI can be powerful, it still relies heavily on its programming and data, which can limit its ability to think creatively in unpredictable situations.

2) In tasks that involve ethical decision-making or critical thinking, humans remain essential in space exploration.

3) In emergency situations, humans are often needed to make quick decisions that AI may not be capable of handling.

4) The challenge of balancing autonomy and human intervention will be key in future space missions involving AI.

5) AI's ability to process large datasets quickly allows it to uncover scientific insights that would take humans much longer to find.

6) Despite AI's ability to identify patterns, humans are needed to interpret those findings and guide the direction of scientific inquiry.

7) By automating routine tasks, AI can allow astronauts to focus on more complex and creative aspects of space missions.

8) As AI systems are given more autonomy, ethical considerations regarding their decisions will become increasingly important.

9) As AI becomes more integrated into space missions, it will be essential to ensure that ethical guidelines are in place to guide its actions.
