Chapter 4 Footnotes

1) In unforeseen situations, such as those encountered on Mars, AI can struggle to respond optimally, often requiring human intervention.

2) Misinterpretations of data are a constant concern when using AI to analyze cosmic phenomena.

3) The extreme environments of space can impair the performance of AI systems, making them less reliable.

4) The question of accountability in the event of AI system failure is a major challenge in managing automated space missions.

5) The ethics of AI in space exploration, particularly in decision-making regarding resources and colony management, remains an open issue.

6) While advanced, AI still lacks human reasoning and creativity, and cannot entirely replace humans in space missions.
