Chapter 6 Footnotes

1) Optimizing resources in space is crucial for astronaut survival, but it must be balanced with their well-being.

2) AI could optimize mission resources, but it should not compromise astronauts' health to maximize efficiency.

3) Unexpected events, such as technical failures or solar storms, require human intervention to complement AI's capabilities.

4) Space presents unpredictable challenges that force AI to constantly adapt to new conditions.

5) Vast distances make real-time communication difficult, making AI essential for instantaneous decisions in remote missions.

6) AI must be able to assess complex situations in the absence of complete data and provide viable solutions.

7) AI must understand and take into account the psychological state of astronauts to support them in an extreme environment.

8) AI systems must be reliable and capable of adapting to space's extreme conditions to function properly.

9) Data security is critical, as cyberattacks or interference could compromise the space mission.
