Chapter 1: Artificial Intelligence and its Origins

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a concept that has fascinated us for over sixty years. Today, when we think about it, AI is part of our daily livesâ€”present in our phones, computers, and even our cars (1). But before it became an omnipresent reality, AI traversed a path full of hurdles, theories, speculations, and groundbreaking discoveries. In this chapter, we will explore the roots of artificial intelligence, its origins, and its early steps as a scientific discipline.

The story of AI begins with one man: Alan Turing. This British mathematician and logician, in the early 20th century, posed a simple but profound question: "Can machines think?" (2) This question would serve as the foundation for the entire field. Turing developed a concept now known as the "Turing machine," a theoretical machine capable of simulating any mathematical algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for the idea that machines could, in theory, execute human-like thinking (3). The Turing machine was crucial in understanding that intelligence does not necessarily reside in a biological body, but in the ability to perform algorithms and solve logical problems (3).

However, it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that the term "artificial intelligence" first appeared, thanks to another computer pioneer, John McCarthy (4). He organized the Dartmouth conference in 1956, which is often considered the official starting point of AI as a scientific research field. This conference brought together visionary researchers who laid the foundations for the first theories and approaches to artificial intelligence, aiming to "create a machine that mimics human intelligence" (5).

From the early days of AI research, the focus was on creating systems capable of solving specific problems. Researchers sought to design machines capable of playing complex games, such as chess, which is a true test of human intelligence (6). The development of programs capable of playing chess was a major success in the first decades. These systems could calculate millions of possible moves, allowing machines to play at a level of competence superior to many human players (7). But these programs were limited by the computing power available at the time, and some challenges remained insurmountable, such as managing complex strategies in unforeseen situations (7).

In the early 1960s, AI research focused on problem-solving programs that used algorithms to "search" for solutions in a large space of possibilities (8). These programs were considered "thinking machines," capable of solving specific problems without human intervention. However, this approach quickly ran into limits, as the complexity of real-world problems could not be solved by arithmetic calculations alone (9). The solution provided by these early efforts was both innovative and insufficient, as it lacked the flexibility needed for more varied and realistic applications (9).

In the 1970s and 1980s, AI progress was marked by the development of expert systems (10). These programs could simulate human expertise in specific fields, such as medical diagnosis or engineering. Expert systems were among the first practical applications of AI in fields once thought to be inaccessible to simple algorithmic logic (11). However, even these systems faced challenges because they were often too rigid and required vast amounts of data to function effectively (12). Furthermore, their ability to adapt to new situations was limited, which hindered their efficiency in constantly evolving contexts (12).

Today, AI continues to develop at a rapid pace, thanks to advances in machine learning and deep learning (13). These techniques allow machines to learn autonomously from vast amounts of data, offering a fascinating glimpse into AI's capabilities. But at the outset, it was unimaginable that we would reach this point. The idea of a machine capable of thinking, learning, and even creating seemed like pure fiction, fueled by the science fiction novels of the time (14).

The influence of science fiction, particularly the science fiction novels of the 1950s and 1960s, played a crucial role in the emergence of AI (15). Works such as those by Isaac Asimov, which describe intelligent robots governed by ethical laws, not only inspired researchers but also fueled debates about the possible consequences of the emergence of thinking machines (16). These ethical debates surrounding intelligent machines have not only fascinated researchers but have also influenced how AI projects were framed in their early development (15).

Today, we live in a world where AI is increasingly capable of solving complex problems across many fields (17). We see AIs that write poems, create music, and develop solutions in areas as diverse as medicine, education, and space (18). But in its early days, AI was a radical concept, a revolutionary idea that defied traditional perceptions of what a machine could achieve (19).
